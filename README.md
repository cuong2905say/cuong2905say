###### 👌 From early secondary school, I tried to decode J2ME game (a very popular game at the time - 2016 - 17s) for watching how the game work? It quiet failed, but my passion followed my life. 

📖 I am studying Information Technology (Computer Science) at Hanoi University of Science and Technology, which has recently been accredited by the ASIIN standard. Expected graduate: April, 2025 with 3.6/4.0 CPA.
